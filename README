Documentation
=============

* Avoid ``.rst`` extensions for files designed to be read directly
  (such as ``README.rst``).

  If the file declares file format in the vim modeline (e.g. ``vim:ft=rst``),
  GitHub no longer requires the extension to render the file correctly.

* Avoid ``.txt`` extensions for files designed to be read directly.

* ``doc/README`` should briefly describe the project.

* There should be ``README`` â†’ ``doc/README`` symlink.

* The ``README`` symlink should not shipped in release tarballs.

* Validate reStructuredText documents with ``rst2xml --strict``.

* DocBook XML documents should be avoided.

* Validate legacy DocBook XML documents with ``xmllint --valid``.

* Check URLs using urlycue_.

* Check that version numbers in documentation and in the code match.

   http://jwilk.net/software/urlycue

Copyright
=========

* In repo, there should be top-level ``LICENSE`` (or ``COPYING``) file.

* In release tarballs, ``LICENSE`` (or ``COPYING``)
  should be moved to the ``doc`` subdirectory.

* Copyright notices should be up-to-date.

* GPLv2 files should carry the following license notice:

   This file is part of *PROJECT*.

   *PROJECT* is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
   the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2 as published by the

* Check spelling with mwic_.

* Check spelling with anorack_.

Python code
===========

* Check Python code with pydiatra_.

* Check Python code with pyflakes_.

* Check Python code with pylint_.

* Python modules should have sensible ``__all__``.

* Validate module long description with ``rst2xml --strict``.

.. _pyflakes:
   https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes
.. _pylint:

Perl code
=========

* Check Perl code with perlcritic_.

* Every Perl script should start with ``no lib '.';``
  as a defence against CVE-2016-1238.

.. _perlcritic:
   https://metacpan.org/release/Perl-Critic

CLI
===

* The ``--version`` option should print to stdout, not stderr.

  Note that in Python prior to 3.4,
  ``argparse`` doesn't do it correctly out of the box:
  https://bugs.python.org/issue18920

* The ``--version`` option should print versions of most important underlying
  libraries.

* The ``--help`` option should print to stdout, not stderr.

* Programs that produce copious amount of output (and do nothing else besides
  that) should have default signal handler for ``SIGPIPE``.

Release tarballs
================

* Files should have sane ownership (``root:root``)
  and permissions (0644 or 0755).

* The POSIX 1003.1-1988 (ustar) format should be used.

Continuous integration
======================

* When possible, the above checks should be automated using CI.
