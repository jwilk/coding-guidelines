* Avoid ``.rst`` extensions for files designed to be read directly
  (such as ``README.rst``).

  If the file declares file format in the vim modeline (e.g. ``vim:ft=rst``),
  GitHub no longer requires the extension to render the file correctly.

* Avoid ``.txt`` extensions for files designed to be read directly.

* In repo, top-level ``README`` should briefly describe the project.

* In release tarball, ``README`` should be in the ``doc`` subdirectory.
